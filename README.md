## 283 Assignment 1

System 1: MacBook Air 2020 with an M1 chip
Failed trials: As stated in the video, I went ahead with the combination of GCP, Nomachine without much experience or proper research. Assigned 4 GB RAM, 20GB HDD space to save the costs. Then, realized there are no ways to implement nested virtualization in this(there might be a way that I’m not aware of).  

System 2, successful installation: 
As the VirtualBox, VMware Fusion, does not yet possess standard versions for the M1 chip model. I opted to find a Windows 10 device with Intel core i5 processor and to use VMWare Workstation 16.0. 

Ubuntu

Ran into numerous errors for not having the required libraries: Bison, Flex, libssl-dev,, libelg-dev, etc, which are resolved using ‘sudo apt-get install XXXX’.
